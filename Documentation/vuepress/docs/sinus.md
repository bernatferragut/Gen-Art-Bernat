# Our teaching approach to the Micro:bit in summer camps

## Summer camps particularities:

- Kids are there to have fun: they want to play
- Age groups are less uniform
- Many kids come because they like computers

## Our approach: take the code out

## The essential role of sound

## On hardware:

### Power and buzzer back plates
The fact that we use the MI-POWER backplate for mictobit did help a lot. This add-on powers the microbit with a 3V battery and provides an ON/OFF switch and a speaker. It gave us a new world of possibilities and make working with the microbits much easier. We highly recommend to addapt all the Microbits with these plates when going to classes. Just the fact of having the tiny speakers doubles the practical usability of the unit for the classes. Since we had some problems with MI-POWER backplates (battery hold break, frequent battery replacement, etc.) we recommend trying to find a different product. The Power:bit from Elecfreaks seams a very good product.

### Audio jack enclosers
To do these activities we had to build enclosers for the Microbits that included an ON/OFF switch and an INPUT audio jack. Also we used a small sound system to amplify the sound. Sound became so important in the activities that we really encourage to boost up this feature. It would be especially important to add sound features to Artbit in the near future to be able to introduce sound to the younger audience.
