# GENERATIVE ART 

## Introduction

### Long time ago, in a far away galaxy...
My life completely changed the day my dad brought me to see a film called TRON back in the 80's. Once the film did finish I thought to myself...this is it, I love these graphics. 

Later came the first days of the Internet in the early 90's with a plugin called macromedia flash which allowed for the first time anybody to start experimenting with graphics and code. 

After that, things evolved slowly and only recently with the standarisation of javascript as the programming language of the web new specialised libraries have appeared to make life easier for artists who want to express themselves in the frontier between design and code.

### P5JS
P5JS is the web javascript version of the seminal java project for artist called Processing (link). 

Born in 2016 and backed by the great and inspirng teacher Daniel Shiffmann (link), it has been growing steadily until becoming the perfect tool to make code accessible to artists, designers, educators and beginners.

### Goals
The Goal with this introductory course is for anybody who wants start creating digital art with the computer screen as their canvas to learn the most fundamental basics of designing art with code

I ask people to know at least a little bit of javascript, enough so can follow the course (variables and loops will be enough). 

If you need a more introductory course here I give a fantastic link of Allisson Parish (link) who has been another great inspiration to create this course for me and it's a perfect complement to better understand some of the concepts we will dive into.

### Structure
This introduction to programming with p5JS course is divided into:

1. Dot class abstraction
2. dot object creation
3. dot animation basics
4. dot sliders
5. dot - row
6. dot - matrix
7. dot - experiments
