# GENERATIVE ART 

## Introduction

### Long time ago, in a far away galaxy...
My life changed completely when I was 8, the day my dad brought me to see a film called TRON back in the 80's. When the film did end I thought to myself...one day I will create graphics like these.

When **Macromedia Flash** came out in the early 90's, it opened up a huge door to the world of computer-generated graphics - anyone could start experimenting and showcase their work on the internet!

In the early 00's, came Processing a specialized library, which make it easier for artists who want to express themselves at the convergence of art and programming.

### P5JS

Born in 2016, P5JS was created by [Lauren McCarthy](http://lauren-mccarthy.com/) and is developed by a community of collaborators with the support of the Processing Foundation and NYU ITP.

It is a Javascript variation of the original [Processing](https://processing.org/) project that was invented for making visual media.

Backed by the wonderfully inspiring teacher [DanielShiffman](https://shiffman.net/), P5JS has been growing steadily and has evolved into an amazing tool to make coding accessible to artists, designers, educators and beginners.

### Purpose
The purpose of this introductory course is to inspire anyone who wants to start creating digital art: learning to use basic coding as the media and a computer screen as the canvas.

Knowing a little bit of Javascript will help with this course: an understanding of loops, variables and modulo will make it easier to follow. It's about reading to understand the code snippets and becoming familiar with them by experimenting.

A fantastic introductory Javascript course is from [AllisonParish](https://creative-coding.decontextualize.com/first-steps/) who has been another great inspiration to create my course. I believe it's a perfect complement for a better understanding of some of the concepts we will dive into.

### Concepts
* Programming: variables, loops, classes, p5js functions.
* Mathematics: translations, modulo, sin and cos functions, random.

### Structure
This introduction for creating Generative Art with p5JS course is divided into:

1. Dot: class abstraction
2. Dot: object creation
3. Dot: animation basics
4. Sliders
5. Rows
6. Matrix
7. Experiments
