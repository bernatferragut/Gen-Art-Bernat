# GENERATIVE ART 

## Introduction

### Long time ago, in a far away galaxy...
My life completely changed the day my dad brought me to see a film called TRON back in the 80's. Once the film did finish I thought to myself...this is it, I love that. 

Then came the early days of Internet in the early 90's with a plugin called macromedia flash which allowed for the first time anybody to start experimenting with graphics and code. 

From that moment things evolved slowly and only recently with the standarisation of javascript as the programming language of the web new specialised libraries have been appearing to make life much easier to be able express to ourselves much better as digital artists who work with code.

### P5JS
P5JS is the web javascript version of the seminal java project for artist Processing (link). 

Born in 2016 and backed by the great and inspirng teacher Daniel Shiffmann (link), it has been growing until become the perfect tool to make code accessible to artists, designers, educators and beginners.

### Goals
My Goal with this introductory course is to anybody who wants start creating digital art with the computer screen as their canvas to learn the most fundamental basics of designing art through code

I ask people to know at least a little bit of javascript, enough so can follow the course (variables and loops will be enough). 

If you need a more introductory course here I give a fantastic link of Allisson Parish (link) who has been another great inspiration to create this course for me and it's a perfect complement to better understand some of the concepts we will dive into.

### Structure
The course is divided in 4 Parts

1. The Dot: abstraction, creation and simple translation animation
2. Advanced animation through mathematical operators and functions
3. Sliders: Value life manipulation
4. Rows and Matrix or indexed and nested loops
5. Mouse interaction
6. Algorithmic art: combining the first 5 sections together with some examples
7. Generative art: Theory and examples
8. Llullian art: a subset of Generative Art
9. Llullian art: examples of the subset
